# Dungeon Tiles

All files are license under Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal. This essentially means do what you want with them and don't worry about it. If you want to read more on the license go here -> https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0-1.0/

These tiles are intended for random generation but can be use to make premade dungeons as well. These files are not finished and are under constant development so check back often for changes.

The models have been tested in Unity, UE4, & GoDot engines. Feel free to test in other engines and let me know if they are working. Also feel free to create branches and edit/add tiles as you see fit.

Current count is 69 tiles
